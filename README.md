.exe should be built already. KancolleQuestTracker/bin/Debug should have it. 

KancolleQuestTracker/bin/Debug/InputFiles has the files needed for your quest tracking DO NOT DELETE THOSE FILES IT WILL BREAK THE APP.
Simply go in and clear the files and input your available quests into the Quests.txt file. Add them in similarly to how they are now. (Ex. "A1,A2,A3...")
